# Volfram

![logo](https://github.com/0ranki/volfram/blob/volfram/resources/img/volfram-logo.png?raw=true)

This is a fork of Element Android, with slight modifications mainly to the UI.

Idea is to stay close to Element, but introduce changes that make the app a bit more approachable.

### Current changes:
- Based on the 1.6.5 release of Element
- Use black theme instead of dark when set to follow system theme
- Toggle for visibility of encryption shields in Labs, by default shields are hidden 
- New icon, name and logo to differentiate from upstream and allow simultaneous install

All credits belong to devs of https://github.com/vector-im/element-android, I barely know what I'm doing with Kotlin.
