# Volfram

This is a fork of Element Android, with slight modifications mainly to the UI.

### Current changes:
- Based on the 1.6.5 release of Element
- Show grey shield instead of red for messages that were encrypted by a logged out device
  - Mautrix-whatsapp bridge's all messages have this, at least in some conditions
- Use black theme instead of dark when set to follow system theme
- New icon, name and logo to differentiate from upstream and allow simultaneous install

All credits belong to devs of https://github.com/vector-im/element-android, I barely know what I'm doing with Kotlin.
